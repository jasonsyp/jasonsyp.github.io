title: Hello World!  An Introduction

Thanks for reading my first blog post.  In most programming language courses the first
code you write is usually a simple program called "Hello World!" that outputs
said message to the command prompt.  When you are in an intensive, 12-week data

class in git and github, complex Python data structures, and analyzing voluminous
amounts of NYC MTA subway turnstile data.  To which I say, "Let's do this!"

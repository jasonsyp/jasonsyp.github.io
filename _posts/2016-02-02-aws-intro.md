title: Pardon the Interruption...We Have a Cloud!
---
<p>No this is not a post about Michael Wilbon's and Tony Cornheiser's show on ESPN. As much as I'd love to continue my lengthy narrative on our second project (don't worry Part II coming soon), I have to interrupt by validating my nerd card and updating you on what we learned today.</p>
<p>In a previous life, the letters AWS were popular because they stood for Alternate Work Schedule, meaning hey boss can I cram all my work hours into a compressed schedule so I can get every other Friday off.  "Do you have AWS, when can I get approved for AWS, I love AWS, etc." were the phrases you heard around the office.</p>
<p>One of the topics I most looked forward to when entering this data science bootcamp, also centered around the letters AWS and similar quotes as above.  Except in this case, AWS is Amazon Web Services.  That's right, we got to join the cloud today, by configuring our own EC2 instance, installing an Ubuntu image and Postgres SQL.  In all seriousness, I'm seriously pumped about this and looking forward to diving deeper (or is it reaching higher) to expand my AWS cloud computing skills.  I know this is just the tip of the iceberg.  But for now.  So yes, I do have AWS and my work schedule is now officially distributed.</p>

Reflecting back on almost a week since our Career Day and Graduation, I can't not say something about the people that were part of this journey with me.  The decision to start this journey was a very personal one, but you don't enter something dubbed a "Bootcamp", expecting to make it through by yourself.  We all got through this together, helping each other and leaning on each other along the way, with the guidance and support of an amazing group of instructors and staff.  I'm proud to be a part of this cohort, and I look forward to keeping in touch with all my classmates and following their respective next steps as they start their careers as data scientists and change the world, one messy data set at a time.

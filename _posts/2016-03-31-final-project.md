title: Bootcamp Final Project
---
This is it.  After 12 weeks, the culmination of of our data science bootcamp experience comes to a close with our Career Day presentations.  

There will be more details to follow, but for my final project I chose to examine prescription drug abuse.  This is a growing epidemic in the U.S. and I wanted to do some exploratory analysis and see what the profile of addiction looks like so we can target prevention and treatment accordingly.  I was able to gather data from several sources, with my primary data set consisting of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Vital Statistics System (NVSS), and survey data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, the largest annual national and state-wide survey on substance abuse and mental health.  

As mentioned during my presentation, I created an interactive D3.js choropleth map that shows the drug overdose deaths by county from 2002-2014.  The D3 visualization can be viewed [here](http://rawgit.com/jasonsyp/metis-datascience/master/projects/final/index.html).  The visualization shows significant increases in deaths throughout the majority of the country, highlighting the severity of the problem.  

To be continued (got to get through these final two days of bootcamp)...
